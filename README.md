# Amazon Clone – HTML & CSS Project

This project is a basic clone of the Amazon homepage, built using **only HTML and CSS**. It's part of my learning journey as a participant in the **DevWeekend Fellowship** 🚀.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Kaniz Sukayna**, a beginner web developer currently learning front-end development through the **DevWeekend Fellowship**. This project helped me practice structuring pages with HTML and styling them with CSS — without using any Java0Script.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – For building the structure of the pages.
- **CSS3** – For styling and layout design.

## 🗂 Pages in This Project

- `index.html` – Main homepage (search bar, banner, product layout).
- `signup.html` – Simple user signup page.
- `cart.html` – Cart view template.
- `orders.html` – A mockup of past orders.
- `style.css` – Main stylesheet used across all pages.

## 📸 What I Learned

- How to create multi-page static websites.
- How to use CSS for layout and design.
- Basic web design structure and file organization.
- Linking pages together with `<a>` tags.

## 🔧 How to Run This Project

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the file `index.html` in your browser.
3. Explore the other pages like `signup.html`, `cart.html`, and `orders.html`.

## 🌱 Still Learning...

This is a beginner-level project, and there's a lot more I'm excited to explore — like JavaScript, responsive design, and interactivity.

## 🏷 Credits

This project was created during the **DevWeekend Fellowship** as part of a Tech Grind challenge.
